### React Todo list

This extremely simple app allows the user to add items to their agenda. Use
`npm` to get it up and running:

    $ npm install && npm start

The prototype application is now available on `localhost`.

## Feature requests

Using React, we currently allow the user to add as many items as they'd like.
We'd like to improve our app with these feature requests:

  * As a user, I can delete (or mark as complete) an item with a double click
  * As a user, I can edit an item with a single click
  * As a user, I can see my previously deleted (or completed) items via a view
    toggle

Please feel free to approach this however you'd like. We prefer candidates
limit themselves to about an hour and produce their best possible work
during that time frame.

## Delivery

Please deliver your application (link, source, or both) to:
