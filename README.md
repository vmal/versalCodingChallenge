### React Todo list

This extremely simple app allows the user to add items to their agenda. Use
`npm` to get it up and running:

    $ npm install && npm start

The prototype application is now available on `localhost`.

## Changes Made

 * For the first feature, the user can double click on the TODO item to delete it or mark it as complete. This item will go in the completed todo list view.
 * For the second feature, the user needs to type something in the input box and then click on the item they want to edit. 
 * For the third feature, there is a toggle view button to switch between viewing the todo list and completed todo list.
## Feature requests

Using React, we currently allow the user to add as many items as they'd like.
We'd like to improve our app with these feature requests:

  * As a user, I can delete (or mark as complete) an item with a double click
  * As a user, I can edit an item with a single click
  * As a user, I can see my previously deleted (or completed) items via a view
    toggle

Please feel free to approach this however you'd like. We prefer candidates
limit themselves to about an hour and produce their best possible work
during that time frame.
